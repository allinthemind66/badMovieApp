# Bad Movie App - Final Project
Basic C++ command line application that reads a list of bad movies from a .tsv file, 
performs some operations on a vector, and cleans up when finished.

This list of bad movies is a long time project and was compiled by me and a friend of mine 
in a lifetime struggle to watch every known bad and cult movie in the universe!
Run the application and follow instructions output from console.
